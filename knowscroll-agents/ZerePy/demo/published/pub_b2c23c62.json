      "script": "Blockchain is a decentralized system that records data across distributed computers. It's used in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, supply chains for transparency, and voting systems to ensure fraud is impossible. Blockchain ensures security through consensus mechanisms. The combination of decentralization, security, and transparency makes blockchain revolutionary.",

      "script": "Different consensus mechanisms like Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Stake (PoS), and Zero-Knowledge-Rolling Hash ensure blockchain systems reach agreement efficiently. PoW uses energy, PoS relies on stake, and ZK-Rolling Hash is faster and reduces trust issues.",
