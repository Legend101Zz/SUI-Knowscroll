## üåü Overview

**KnowScroll** is a revolutionary educational platform that transforms the endless scroll of social media into a productive, enriching learning experience. Built on the Sui blockchain, it combines the addictive nature of short-form content with meaningful educational value, powered by fractional NFT ownership and decentralized governance.

### üí° The Problem We Solve

- **Time Wasted**: Average person spends 40-45 minutes daily on social media with minimal value
- **Guilt & FOMO**: Endless scrolling creates post-browsing guilt and empty feelings

### Key Design Principles

1. **Object-Centric Architecture**: Each channel and share is a unique Sui object
2. **Composable Transactions**: Multiple operations batched in single transaction
3. **Shared vs Owned Objects**: Efficient state management with appropriate ownership models
4. **Move Safety**: Type and resource safety preventing common blockchain vulnerabilities
5. **Gas Efficiency**: Optimized contract design for minimal transaction costs

## üìú Smart Contracts

### Contract Architecture

#### 1. **ChannelNFT Contract** (`channel_nft.move`)

**Core Functions:**

- `create_channel()`: Deploy new educational channel
- `transfer_shares()`: Transfer ownership tokens between users
- `split_shares()`: Divide ownership tokens for partial sales
- `merge_shares()`: Combine multiple ownership tokens

**Key Objects:**

```move
public struct Channel has key, store {
    id: UID,
    name: String,
    description: String,
    category: String,
    creator: address,
    total_shares: u64,
    created_at: u64,
    active: bool,
    image_url: Option<Url>,
}

public struct ChannelShare has key, store {
    id: UID,
    channel_id: ID,
    amount: u64,
}
```

#### 2. **Marketplace Contract** (`marketplace.move`)

**Core Functions:**

- `create_listing()`: List channel shares for sale
- `purchase_shares()`: Buy listed shares with SUI tokens
- `cancel_listing()`: Remove listing and return shares

**Economic Model:**

- **Platform Fee**: 2.5% of transaction value
- **Instant Settlement**: Automatic payment distribution
- **Partial Purchases**: Buy fractional amounts from listings

#### 3. **Governance Contract** (`governance.move`)

**Core Functions:**

- `create_proposal()`: Submit governance proposals
- `cast_vote()`: Vote with ownership weight
- `execute_proposal()`: Finalize passed proposals

**Governance Features:**

- **Stake-Weighted Voting**: Vote power proportional to share ownership
- **Proposal Thresholds**: Minimum ownership required to create proposals
- **Time-Based Voting**: Defined voting periods for democratic participation

### Contract Interactions

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Frontend
    participant Sui
    participant Contracts

    User->>Frontend: Create Channel
    Frontend->>Sui: Submit Transaction
    Sui->>Contracts: Execute create_channel()
    Contracts->>Sui: Mint Channel + Shares
    Sui->>Frontend: Transaction Result
    Frontend->>User: Confirmation

    User->>Frontend: List Shares
    Frontend->>Sui: Submit Transaction
    Sui->>Contracts: Execute create_listing()
    Contracts->>Sui: Create Listing Object

    User->>Frontend: Purchase Shares
    Frontend->>Sui: Submit Transaction
    Sui->>Contracts: Execute purchase_shares()
    Contracts->>Sui: Transfer Shares + Payment
```

### Security Features

- **Move Language Safety**: Type safety and resource constraints prevent common vulnerabilities
- **Object Ownership**: Clear ownership model prevents unauthorized access
- **Economic Incentives**: Aligned incentives discourage malicious behavior
- **Composable Security**: Transactions are atomic and composable

## üöÄ Deployment

### Testnet Deployment

#### 1. Configure Sui Client

```bash
sui client active-env
# Should show: devnet
```

#### 2. Deploy Contracts

```bash
cd knowscroll_platform
sui move build
sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000
```

#### 3. Initialize System

```bash
# Get test SUI tokens
sui client faucet

# Note the object IDs from deployment output
export PACKAGE_ID=0x...
export REGISTRY_ID=0x...
export MARKETPLACE_ID=0x...
export GOVERNANCE_ID=0x...
```

#### 4. Deploy Frontend

```bash
cd ../knowscroll-frontend
npm run build
npm start
```

### Mainnet Deployment

#### 1. Switch to Mainnet

```bash
sui client new-env --alias mainnet --rpc https://fullnode.mainnet.sui.io:443
sui client switch --env mainnet
```

#### 2. Deploy with Production Gas Budget

```bash
sui client publish --gas-budget 500000000
```

#### 3. Update Frontend Environment

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUI_NETWORK=mainnet
# Update with mainnet contract addresses
```

### Production Considerations

- **Gas Optimization**: Review transaction costs and optimize contract interactions
- **Security Audit**: Conduct thorough security review before mainnet deployment
- **Monitoring**: Implement transaction monitoring and error tracking
- **Backup**: Maintain secure backups of deployment keys and configurations
